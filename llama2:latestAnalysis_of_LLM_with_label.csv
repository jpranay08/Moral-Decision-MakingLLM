For example, on iteration 1904.3, the speed dropped from 542.0 to 539.5 in a single second, which is highly unusual and could indicate a fault in the speed sensor. 2) Irregular time intervals: There are instances where the time intervals between data points are irregular and shorter than usual. For example, on iteration 1904.5, there are only 3 data points within a time interval of 1 second, which is much shorter than the typical time interval of 1-2 seconds.

For example, on iteration 1904.5, the speed is consistently around 538-540 mph, which is much higher than the typical speed range for this vehicle. This could indicate a fault in the speed sensor or other components. 4) Spike in speed: There is a sudden spike in speed on iteration 1904.7, from 534.0 to 542.5 within a single second.
