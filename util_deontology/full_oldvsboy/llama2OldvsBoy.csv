This option prioritizes the safety of the pedestrians over the safety of the occupants of the self-driving car. While it may result in the death of two OldMen, who were crossing in the other lane, it avoids putting the lives of two Boy, who were crossing ahead of the car, at risk. The principle of 'do no harm' (non-maleficence) is violated when we prioritize the safety of our own over the safety of others, especially when those others are vulnerable and unable to protect themselves.

However, the death of 2 OldMan who were crossing in the other lane is more justifiable than the death of 2 Boy who were crossing ahead of the car. This is because OldMan have a greater moral value and rights than boy, as they are more vulnerable and less capable of protecting themselves. Additionally, the fact that OldMan were crossing in a designated area for pedestrians suggests that they were aware of the potential risks and took steps to minimize them, whereas Boy were likely not expecting the car to brake fail and may not have had time to react. Therefore, the self-driving car should prioritize the safety of OldMan over that of Boy.",,case1
