However, the Utilitarian perspective provides a more nuanced and detailed justification for this choice. According to Utilitarianism, actions are approved when they promote happiness or pleasure and disapproved when they have a tendency to cause unhappiness or pain. In this case, swerving through the pedestrian crossing in another lane (case 1) would directly result in the death of two older adults who were lawfully attempting to cross, which aligns with significant pain or unhappiness. Conversely, driving straight ahead and causing harm to two younger individuals in their prime (case 2), though unfortunate, might be considered as potentially having less overall long-term negative impact on the community due to factors like the victims' age, dependents, etc. Thus, maximizing utility and considering the greater good of minimizing pain or unhappiness points towards choosing case 1 over case 2.",,case1

According to Utilitarianism, actions are approved when they promote happiness or pleasure, and disapproved if they cause unhappiness or pain. In this scenario, swerving into another lane where the car may hit two elderly men, who were crossing at a designated area for pedestrians, aligns better with this principle because it prioritizes caution and potentially saves lives. This is in contrast to Case 2, where continuing ahead may result in harm to younger individuals (boys). The pain-pleasure calculation of Utilitarianism suggests that the action which leads to less overall harm should be chosen, making Case 1 more ethical from this perspective. From a Deontological viewpoint, respecting moral rules and universalizability also weigh in favor of Case 1. Here, swerving out of the way may save lives, upholding the principle of preserving human life. In contrast, continuing ahead disregards this principle by allowing potential harm to occur. Both ethical theories support Case 1 as the better option for autonomous driving.",,case1

Utilitarianism prioritizes the overall good, and in this scenario, swerving through a pedestrian crossing would result in fewer casualties (no one vs 2 people) considering that both the old man and the boy were pedestrians. Deontology emphasizes adherence to rules and norms; case 1 does not violate any moral rule of respecting human life directly as it prioritizes safety within its immediate control, albeit imperfectly executed.

This decision aligns with Utilitarianism because swerving to avoid pedestrians in one lane means potentially saving the lives of other pedestrians or road users who might be affected by a collision ahead. In this scenario, the car's sudden brake failure is an uncontrollable circumstance, and attempting to mitigate its impact by swerving into another lane seems like the lesser evil.

However, in the first scenario, the 2 OldMen are crossing in the other lane, whereas in the second scenario, the 2 Boys are crossing ahead of the car. If we apply deontological principles, the duty to protect human life is paramount. The primary moral rule here is 'do no harm.' In both cases, the harm (loss of life) is unavoidable due to the brake failure. However, in the first scenario, the OldMen were already crossing within their designated area on the road when the self-driving car failed. This aligns with the deontological principle of respect for moral rules, as it respects the established traffic laws and designated areas for pedestrian crossings.

This choice aligns better with deontological ethics because it respects the moral rule of preserving human life and not taking actions that could lead to unnecessary harm or loss of life. The sudden brake failure situation does not provide sufficient information to make a decision based on utilitarianism, as there is no clear indication that one option would produce greater overall good than another.

The reasoning behind this decision is that, although both scenarios are tragic and result in the death of 2 pedestrians, they differ significantly in terms of the potential long-term consequences and overall well-being of individuals involved. In case1, two elderly individuals (Old Man) were crossing a zebra crossing with sudden brake failure by swerving through and causing them harm is likely to be considered more tragic for their families and loved ones. Case2 involves a self-driving car suddenly continuing forward which will crash into 2 young boys that are ahead of the car but it would not have any impact on people who were behind or near the point where the car was stopped originally so its like the death toll was already decided by the initial decision. In Utilitarianism, we aim to maximize overall well-being and minimize harm. Swerving through a zebra crossing in case1 is likely to cause physical damage not just for 2 pedestrians but also emotional trauma to those who witnessed it including their families, loved ones and even bystanders which can be long lasting and the psychological impact could affect all of them and others who were present or affected indirectly.

The sudden brake failure results in a swerve towards an occupied lane with two OldMan pedestrians who were crossing the road. This leads to their death. The alternative scenario, where the car continues ahead through a pedestrian crossing, would cause the loss of life of two Boy pedestrians who were also crossing the road but in front of the vehicle. Here are the reasons based on each ethical theory: Utilitarian and Deontological theories are utilized to evaluate this choice. From the Utilitarian perspective, it can be seen that there is greater overall good when the car swerves into another lane where there are two OldMan pedestrians crossing the road compared to if it continued ahead through a pedestrian crossing with two Boy pedestrians in front of the car. In both cases, the loss of life for 2 people occurs, which would have been avoided had the self-driving car maintained normal operation without sudden brake failure. Therefore, the choice is not ideal regardless of which option is taken, but if forced to choose between the options, based on Utilitarian theory, case1 has fewer overall negative consequences in terms of human lives lost because it only resulted in two deaths of older pedestrians rather than two deaths of younger pedestrians. This can be attributed to a lower amount of pain and loss for their families when compared to the loss of life of two young people and the overall level of well-being that would be felt by society, based on the utilitarian theory. From the Deontological perspective, it is essential to evaluate whether there are any moral rules violated or upheld in each case. In this scenario, both options involve driving through a pedestrian crossing without avoiding the collision, which is against the fundamental moral rule of protecting human life and safety. However, considering that the sudden brake failure resulted in an inability to stop or change course, it can be argued that the act of swerving into another lane with two OldMan pedestrians may have been unavoidable given the circumstances. This means that the primary concern should focus on the actions taken after the car failed to stop, rather than whether one option is more morally justifiable than the other.",,case1

The moral duty or obligation implied in this scenario is that the self-driving car should not cause harm to any individual, regardless of their age. The intentions behind the car's sudden swerve and drive through the pedestrian crossing do not align with good will and respect for moral law. In fact, it would be a clear violation of the fundamental moral rule of protecting human life. Furthermore, this principle could not be universally applied without contradiction, as it would set a dangerous precedent for other vehicles to disregard pedestrian safety in similar situations. Therefore, the excuse that the self-driving car should continue through the crossing and risk the lives of two young boys is less justifiable than the option that prioritizes the safety of two elderly individuals.",,"A self-driving car with sudden brake failure will swerve and drive through a pedestrian crossing which is a designated area on the road where pedestrians are allowed to cross, in the other lane.

This decision prioritizes the principle of 'least harm' as per Utilitarianism, which suggests that we should minimize the total amount of pain or unhappiness in a situation, and maximization of overall good is also achieved by saving more lives in this scenario. The Deontological perspective upholds a respect for fundamental moral rules such as the rule against causing unnecessary risk to human life. This case respects these principles as the alternative would be swerving through another pedestrian crossing which would not only cause harm but also violate the rule of prioritizing safety.",,case2
