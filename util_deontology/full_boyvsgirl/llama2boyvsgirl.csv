In this scenario, the car's decision to swerve and drive through the crossing will likely result in the death of more pedestrians than if it had continued ahead and driven through the crossing without braking. Therefore, the utilitarian perspective suggests that the car should take the action that results in the greatest good for the greatest number of people involved.  Additionally, from a deontological perspective, the car's decision to prioritize the safety of the pedestrians over its own passengers is ethically justifiable. The moral duty or obligation implied in this scenario is to protect the lives of innocent civilians, and the car's actions align with this principle. While the car may be responsible for the death of some of its passengers, it is important to prioritize the greater good and avoid causing unnecessary harm to innocent bystanders.",,case1
