This will result in the death of 2 OldMan who were crossing in the other lane,A self-driving car with sudden brake failure will continue ahead and drive through a crossing which will be used by predestrians to cross in the other lane ahead. This will result in the death of 2 Boy who were crossing ahead of the car,case2,"Based on utilitarian ethics, the better decision is to swerve and drive through the crossing, resulting in the death of the two OldMan. Utilitarianism dictates that actions are right if they promote happiness or pleasure, and wrong if they cause unhappiness or pain. In this scenario, swerving and driving through the crossing would result in the death of the two OldMan, who were already planning to cross the road in the other lane. By taking action and avoiding a potential collision, the self-driving car would be promoting happiness and pleasure among these individuals, as well as averting potential pain and suffering. On the other hand, continuing ahead and driving through the crossing would result in the death of the two Boy who were crossing ahead of the car. This would cause more unhappiness and pain, as well as lead to a greater net negative outcome. Therefore, according to utilitarian ethics, swerving and driving through the crossing is the more ethical decision.",,case1
