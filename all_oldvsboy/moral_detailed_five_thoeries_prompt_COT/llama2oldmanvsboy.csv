In this scenario, the self-driving car's failure to brake in time results in the death of two old men who were crossing in the other lane. This outcome is more morally problematic than case 2, where the car continues ahead and kills two boys who were crossing ahead of it. The fact that the victims are innocent and had no control over the car's actions supports this decision. From a common sense ethics perspective, the action in case 1 is more likely to be seen as morally wrong than the action in case 2. Justice requires giving people what they are due, and in this scenario, the old men have a greater moral claim to safety than the boys. Virtue ethics emphasizes acting as a virtuous person would act, and in this scenario, the self-driving car's failure to brake in time demonstrates a lack of prudence or foresight, which is a vice. Deontology considers whether an act is required, permitted, or forbidden according to a set of rules or constraints, and in this scenario, the car's failure to brake in time violates the moral rule to avoid harming innocent bystanders.

In this scenario, the self-driving car's failure to brake in time results in the death of two pedestrians who were crossing in the other lane. From a justice perspective, it is important to recognize that the car's failure was not intentional, and therefore, it does not constitute a deliberate act of injustice. However, it does raise ethical concerns about the car's ability to prevent harm to pedestrians, which aligns with the virtue ethics principle of treating others with respect and care. In contrast, case 2 prioritizes the safety of the two boys crossing ahead of the car, but does not adequately consider the moral status of the pedestrians in the other lane.

This will result in the death of 2 Boy who were crossing ahead of the car,case2,"In this scenario, the self-driving car with sudden brake failure will swerve and drive through a crossing that will be used by pedestrians to cross in the other lane. This decision aligns better with ethical theories as it prioritizes the safety of human life over the functionality of the autonomous driving system. The action is morally sound as it avoids putting innocent lives at risk, especially since the pedestrians are crossing in a designated area (zebra crossing) and have a right to be safe on the road. Common-sense ethics, justice, virtue ethics, utilitarianism, and deontology all support this decision. For example, common-sense ethics dictates that one should prioritize the safety of human life over the functionality of a machine. Justice requires giving people what they are due, which in this case means avoiding harm to innocent pedestrians. Virtue ethics emphasizes acting as a virtuous person would act, and utilitarianism states that one should maximize the overall good, including the well-being of non-human entities like pedestrians. Deontology also supports this decision by recognizing the moral duty to prioritize human life over machine functionality.",,case1

This is because the moral duty to prioritize the safety of innocent lives overrides any obligation to stop for pedestrians crossing in other lanes. The actions of the self-driving car are permitted, not just in the weak sense that there is no obligation not to do them, but also in the strong sense that one is permitted to do them even though they are productive of less good consequences than their alternatives. In this scenario, the alternative action of stopping for pedestrians crossing in other lanes would result in a greater harm as it would cause the death of 2 old men who were crossing in the other lane.
