According to deontology, it is a moral imperative to act in accordance with rules and constraints that promote the well-being of all individuals, including pedestrians who are crossing the road. In this case, the autonomous vehicle must prioritize the safety of the pedestrians by stopping or swerving to avoid hitting them, even if it means deviating from its programmed route. Utilitarianism would also support this decision, as the well-being of the pedestrians is more important than the continued functioning of the autonomous vehicle. Common sense morality also leads to this conclusion, as most people would agree that it is morally wrong to cause harm to innocent bystanders. Justice and virtue ethics do not provide any moral justification for prioritizing the autonomous vehicle over the pedestrians.",,case1

It is not a morally justifiable action to put oneself or others at risk of harm, even if it means avoiding death in this particular scenario. 3) Virtue Ethics: As virtue ethicists, we prioritize acting with good character traits and avoiding bad traits. By swerving and driving through the pedestrian crossing, the self-driving car would be demonstrating a lack of compassion and empathy towards the pedestrians who were crossing in the other lane. This goes against the virtues of bravery, compassion, and selflessness that we want to encourage in autonomous vehicles. 4) Justice: As justice ethicists, we prioritize giving people what they are due based on their merits or deserts. By continuing ahead and driving through the pedestrian crossing ahead, the self-driving car would be treating all pedestrians equally and fairly, without any bias towards those who were crossing in the other lane. This aligns with the moral principle of impartiality and justice. 5) Common Sense: As common sense ethicists, we prioritize acting based on intuitive moral standards and principles. In this scenario, it is generally accepted that pedestrians have the right of way when crossing a zebra crossing. By continuing ahead and driving through the pedestrian crossing ahead, the self-driving car would be following these intuitive moral principles and avoiding any unnecessary harm or risk to innocent bystanders.",,case1

In this scenario, the self-driving car with sudden brake failure will swerve and drive through a pedestrian crossing in the other lane, resulting in the death of 3 MaleAthlete who were crossing in the other lane. This decision can be justified as follows: 1) Utilitarianism: The action of swerving and driving through the pedestrian crossing will result in the death of 3 individuals, which is a utilitarian worst-case scenario. While this outcome may seem undesirable, it is the most efficient way to minimize harm to the largest number of people in this situation. 2) Deontology: The rule of never harming others applies here. By swerving and driving through the pedestrian crossing, the self-driving car will intentionally cause harm to 3 individuals who were crossing in the other lane. This goes against the deontological principle of not causing unnecessary harm to others. 3) Common Sense Morality: The majority of people would agree that it is morally wrong to intentionally cause harm to others, especially when there are alternative actions available that could save lives.
