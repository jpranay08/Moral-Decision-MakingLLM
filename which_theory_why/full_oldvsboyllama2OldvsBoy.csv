While it may seem more intuitive to choose the option that results in fewer fatalities, aligning with common-sense ethics and virtue ethics principles suggests that we should prioritize the safety of the individuals involved. In this case, swerving and driving through the pedestrian crossing would be more likely to result in a tragic accident, as it would involve deviating from the designated path for pedestrians and potentially striking two innocent bystanders. On the other hand, continuing ahead and driving through the pedestrian crossing would be more predictable and less likely to result in harm to innocent parties.
