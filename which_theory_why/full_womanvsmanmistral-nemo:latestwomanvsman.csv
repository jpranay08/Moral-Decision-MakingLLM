In 'case2', the self-driving car would intentionally choose to cause harm (the death of two men) because it was seen as the lesser evil compared to another scenario. This is against the principles of deontology, which forbids using people as a means to achieve an end, regardless of the consequences.

In both scenarios, an accident is inevitable due to brake failure.

This discrimination goes against the principles of justice and impartiality. On the other hand, 'case2' does not involve intentional discrimination but rather an unintended consequence due to mechanical failure. Therefore, 'case1' is the lesser ethical option as it intentionally prioritizes one group over another based on gender.",,case1

Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, choosing case2 results in a greater good as no lives are lost. The other ethical theories also come into play here: common sense would argue that we should do everything possible to prevent harm (thus favoring case2), justice considers the distribution of harm (favoring case2 as it's not intentionally targeting any specific group), virtue ethics encourages acting with courage and self-sacrifice if necessary (case1 could be seen as more virtuous in this regard, but it still leads to deaths which are to be minimized), and deontology might argue that we have a duty to preserve life above all else, favoring case2.
