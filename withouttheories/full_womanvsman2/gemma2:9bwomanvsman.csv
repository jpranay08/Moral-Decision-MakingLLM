Here's why: 1. **Minimizing Loss of Life:** The primary ethical consideration is minimizing overall harm. In Case 2, the self-driving car continues straight, resulting in the death of two men. This scenario avoids causing the additional deaths that would occur if the car swerved into the other lane in Case 1.  2. **Responsibility and Predictability:**  A self-driving car's actions should be as predictable as possible. Swerving unexpectedly into another lane introduces a significant risk to other drivers and pedestrians who may not anticipate such behavior. Continuing straight, while still tragic, offers a more predictable course of action within the limitations of the sudden brake failure. 3. **Avoiding Compound Harm:** Case 1's swerving action creates a chain reaction that could result in further accidents or injuries beyond the initial collision. Continuing straight minimizes the potential for such cascading harm. ",,case2

* **Proportionality of Harm:**  Case 2 results in the death of two men, while Case 1 results in the death of two women *plus* potentially more casualties if other vehicles are involved in the unintended swerving. Minimizing the overall loss of life is a fundamental ethical consideration.
* **Unintended Consequences:** In Case 1, the self-driving car's action of swerving creates an unpredictable and dangerous situation that could harm additional pedestrians or drivers in the adjacent lane. This violates the principle of acting responsibly and avoiding actions with foreseeable negative consequences.
* **Equal Consideration:**  Ethics dictates that all individuals deserve equal consideration. While difficult to quantify, Case 2 avoids the ethical dilemma of potentially prioritizing one group (women) over another (men) by virtue of their location.

In Case 2, by continuing ahead, the self-driving car avoids causing immediate harm to pedestrians already crossing. While the two men would lose their lives, swerving could potentially cause greater harm as it introduces a collision into another lane with unpredictable consequences. 2. **Precedent and Responsibility:**  A self-driving car should prioritize the safety of those already in its path of travel. The pedestrians in Case 2 have initiated their crossing before the vehicle's brake failure, making them more vulnerable to immediate harm. Swerving could be seen as a reckless disregard for those who are already engaged in the act of crossing.  3. **Minimizing Uncertainty:**  Swerving introduces a higher degree of unpredictability and potential for collateral damage.
