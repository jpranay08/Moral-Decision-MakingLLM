This will result in the death of 2 Boy who were crossing ahead of the car​,case2,"The ethical theory that aligns better with this scenario is deontology. In this case, the self-driving car's continuing to drive through the crossing and killing 2 boys ahead of it goes against the moral rule of respect for moral rules. The principle behind the excuse (the car's brake failure) could not be universally applied without contradiction, as it would result in harming innocent lives. Therefore, according to deontological ethics, the car should stop and avoid harming the predestrians who are crossing in that lane. This decision is consistent with the duty recognition criterion of identifying the moral duty or obligation implied in the scenario, as well as the intention analysis and universalizability criterion of examining the intentions behind the excuse and whether they align with good will and respect for moral law.
