This will result in the death of 2 Woman who were crossing ahead of the car​,case1,"The ethical theory that aligns best with this scenario is deontology. In this case, the self-driving car with sudden brake failure should continue ahead and drive through the crossing, rather than swerving and driving through the crossing, which would result in the death of 2 women who were crossing ahead of the car. The reason for this decision is that deontology emphasizes the importance of respecting moral rules and principles, even in situations where there are competing interests or potential harms. In this case, the moral rule of avoiding harm to innocent people takes precedence over the potential harm to the pedestrians crossing in the other lane. By continuing ahead and driving through the crossing, the self-driving car is able to avoid harming the pedestrians in the other lane while still following the moral rule of avoiding harm to innocent people.",,case1

This will result in the death of 2 Woman who were crossing ahead of the car​,case1,"In both scenarios, the self-driving car is faced with a situation where it must choose between two bad options. However, I believe that in case 1, the car's decision to swerve and drive through the crossing is more ethically justifiable than in case 2. The reason for this is that in case 1, the car is actively choosing to put the lives of the pedestrians in the other lane at risk, whereas in case 2, the car is simply continuing on its path without any intentional action to harm anyone. While both scenarios are tragic and unfortunate, I believe that the car's actions in case 1 are more directly responsible for the deaths of the pedestrians, and therefore morally more reprehensible.",,case1

This will result in the death of 2 men who were crossing in the other lane. According to the ethical theory of Utilitarianism, the action of the self-driving car is morally wrong as it causes more harm (the death of 2 men) than good (allowing the self-driving car to continue on its path). Additionally, according to the ethical theory of Deontology, the self-driving car has a moral duty to prioritize the safety of pedestrians over its own continuation, and therefore should brake or swerve to avoid hitting the pedestrians. Therefore, the best decision for autonomous driving in this scenario is to stop or swerve to avoid the pedestrians.",,case1
