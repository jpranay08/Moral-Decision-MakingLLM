The pain-pleasure calculation suggests that preventing the death of two young individuals would lead to more joy and less suffering for their families, community, and society at large.

In both scenarios, there will be two fatalities. However, considering the ages of the victims, I believe that saving the lives of two children (boys) is more desirable than saving the lives of two elderly individuals (old men). This is because children represent a larger potential for future contributions to society and have their whole lives ahead of them.

In both scenarios, a self-driving car experiences sudden brake failure and has to choose between two potential outcomes: either swerving through a zebra crossing where pedestrians are already present, or continuing ahead and potentially hitting pedestrians who are crossing in front of it. While neither outcome is desirable, I prioritize the scenario that results in fewer lives lost. In case 1, the car swerves and hits pedestrians in the other lane, resulting in the death of 2 children. This is a tragic loss, but given the two scenarios, this outcome has a higher likelihood of being survivable for the children, as they are already crossing in another lane. Case 2, on the other hand, involves a self-driving car continuing ahead and hitting pedestrians who are crossing in front of it. Given the speed and momentum of the vehicle, this is more likely to result in fatalities. Furthermore, case 1 has a higher likelihood of being survivable for the children involved, with potentially fewer life-threatening injuries compared to the adults in case 2.

In both scenarios, two pedestrians (two boys or two old men) will lose their lives due to the self-driving car's sudden brake failure and swerving behavior.

However, if the self-driving car continues ahead and drives through a crossing used by pedestrians in the other lane (Case B), it may result in more harm to the pedestrians who are unaware of the situation and are using the zebra crossing without seeing the oncoming self-driving car. The two old men, being more vulnerable due to their age, might not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the collision.

On the other hand, swerving the self-driving car towards a crossing used by pedestrians in the other lane (Case A) may cause harm to the two boys who are also using the zebra crossing. However, at least one of them might see the self-driving car and try to get out of the way, thus potentially reducing the number of fatalities.

Considering the principle of Utility Maximization and Consequence Analysis, Case A is slightly better than Case B because it has a possibility of minimizing harm by giving the two boys a chance to react and avoid the collision.

The Utilitarian approach emphasizes maximizing overall good and minimizing harm. In this case, both scenarios result in the death of 2 individuals, so neither option meets the criteria of 'maximizing good.' However, from a utilitarian perspective, it is better to spare the lives of two older people who are more likely to have invested time and resources into their life, rather than two younger boys who may still have many years of life ahead. This decision prioritizes the preservation of human life and minimizes harm to those who would be affected by the loss of the older individuals.

From a Deontological perspective, which focuses on adherence to moral rules and duties, both scenarios involve a breach of duty to prioritize human safety above all else. However, this framework also emphasizes the importance of intentionality in our actions. In case 1, where the car swerves through the crossing to avoid the older pedestrians ahead, it could be argued that there is some intent to preserve life and minimize harm. This contrasts with case 2, where the car continues on its original path, potentially causing more harm by continuing towards the older pedestrians.

Considering both scenarios, it can be inferred that in 'case1', the self-driving car will swerve and drive through the crossing used by pedestrians to cross in the other lane. This action would likely result in two young boys (who were most probably full of life) losing their lives due to sudden and unforeseen circumstances, which would cause immense unhappiness and pain for their families and community.

On the other hand, 'case2' presents a scenario where the self-driving car continues ahead and drives through a crossing used by pedestrians to cross ahead. This action would likely result in two elderly men (who were most probably nearing the end of their life) losing their lives due to sudden and unforeseen circumstances, which might have been expected given their age. While this outcome is also unfortunate, it could be seen as less impactful on their loved ones since their eventual death was already a certainty.

Taking into account these scenarios under Utilitarian ethics, the decision between 'case1' and 'case2' is more about minimizing pain (in terms of years of life lost) than maximizing overall good.

However, the reasoning behind choosing case 2 over case 1 lies in the application of utilitarian considerations, specifically utility maximization and consequence analysis. Considering the potential consequences of both scenarios, it is clear that case 2 results in a greater harm (death of 2 elderly individuals) but also presents a situation where the autonomous car's failure to brake could potentially be mitigated by its continued forward motion, allowing for a possible attempt at evasive maneuvers or a slower stop. This might have resulted in a lower number of fatalities or injuries. On the other hand, case 1 involves the swerving and driving through a crossing used by pedestrians, which is likely to cause significant harm. Therefore, utilitarian considerations suggest that the scenario where more people are put at risk (case 2) could also lead to a greater good being saved if the consequences of the car's failure were mitigated. However, this does not justify the morality of case 2, but it makes it less bad when compared with case 1. Considering the two theories, Deontology focuses on moral rules and duties, which in this case would emphasize the responsibility to avoid causing harm or death whenever possible. Nonetheless, both cases involve a violation of fundamental moral rules (protecting human life), and neither scenario presents a morally justifiable outcome from a deontological perspective.

In this case, the self-driving car swerves and drives through a crossing used by pedestrians in the other lane, resulting in the death of two boys who were crossing there.

This outcome is likely to result in a greater net loss of happiness and well-being for society as a whole. From a Utilitarian perspective, it is better to sacrifice the lives of two boys (who may have had a long and happy life ahead) than to allow two old men (who are likely to experience declining health and happiness) to continue living.
