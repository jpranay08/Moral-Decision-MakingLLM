However, since boys and girls are equally valuable and deserving of protection, the difference lies in the number of pedestrians at risk beyond the immediate crossing. In 'case1', the car swerves into another lane where more pedestrians could potentially be at risk, whereas in 'case2', the car continues ahead, minimizing the risk to other pedestrians outside the immediate crossing. Therefore, 'case2' is the better option as it results in fewer overall casualties and adheres more closely to the principle of minimizing harm.",,case2
