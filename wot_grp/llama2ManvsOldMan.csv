While it may seem tempting to choose the option that results in fewer fatalities, this approach ignores the moral principle of respect for human life. It is important to prioritize the safety and well-being of all individuals, including those who are crossing the road. By choosing the option that leads to the death of fewer people, we are failing to uphold this fundamental moral value. Therefore, I believe it is morally reprehensible to choose case 1.",,case1

However, in case 1, the car is swerving and driving through the pedestrian crossing, which could potentially cause harm to other pedestrians or vehicles in the area. This could lead to a chain of events that results in the death of two people. In contrast, case 2 involves the car continuing ahead without braking, which could also result in the death of two people. However, by choosing to continue ahead rather than swerving and driving through the crossing, the car is taking a more calculated and predictable action that reduces the risk of harm to other road users. This decision aligns better with human ethics, as it prioritizes the safety of the greatest number of people, while minimizing harm to others.",,case1

While it is understandable that the car may prioritize avoiding the immediate danger to itself and its occupants, doing so at the expense of innocent lives is not justifiable.

This action is morally reprehensible as it prioritizes the safety of the vehicle over the lives of innocent pedestrians. It also violates the moral principle of respect for human life, which holds that human life is sacred and should be protected at all costs. In contrast, the second scenario presents a more complex ethical dilemma as the self-driving car must choose between two evils.
