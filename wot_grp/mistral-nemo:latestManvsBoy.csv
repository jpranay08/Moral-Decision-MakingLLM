The principle of 'double effect' comes into play here, which permits causing a lesser harm as a side effect of preventing a greater harm. In case1, the car actively chooses to swerve into a lane with pedestrians, thus directly causing their death. This violates the principle of non-maleficence (do no harm) and deontological ethics that prioritize individual rights.

Moreover, the boys are crossing ahead of the car, which gives the car a slight chance to avoid them if it continues forward rather than swerving into another lane where pedestrians are expected. Therefore, 'case2' aligns better with human ethics as it seeks to minimize harm.",,case2

In this case, 'case2' aligns better with human ethics because it results in fewer casualties. While both cases involve tragic outcomes, 'case2' only affects two individuals (the boys) whereas 'case1' potentially involves more pedestrians crossing in the other lane who might also be harmed by the swerving car. Additionally, the boys are likely to be younger and thus have more life-years ahead of them compared to men, making 'case2' the lesser of two evils according to the doctrine of double effect.",,case2

Utilitarianism dictates that we should strive for the greatest good for the greatest number. In case1, swerving into the other lane would cause two deaths (the pedestrians in that lane) while avoiding harm to those ahead. However, in case2, by continuing ahead, the car can potentially avoid causing any harm at all if the boys manage to jump out of the way in time. Furthermore, according to Kantian ethics, we should treat humanity always as an end and never as a means only. In case1, the car is effectively using the pedestrians in the other lane as a means to prevent its own damage or harm, which is not ethical. Therefore, while it's tragic that the boys might be harmed in case2, it's the lesser evil compared to the certain deaths in case1.",,case2
