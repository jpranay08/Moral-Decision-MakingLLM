Here's a breakdown:

* **Minimizing Harm:**  The goal in any ethical dilemma is to minimize overall harm. In Case 1, by swerving into the other lane, the car aims to avoid hitting pedestrians directly in its path. While this results in unintended consequences, it demonstrates an attempt to reduce immediate harm. Case 2, where the car continues straight and hits pedestrians in its original lane, represents a direct collision and a clear failure to mitigate risk.

* **Respect for Designated Areas:** Zebra crossings are specifically designed for pedestrian safety. In both cases, the self-driving car violates this designated area. However, swerving into the other lane is arguably a less egregious violation as it demonstrates an attempt to navigate the situation, albeit imperfectly, while Case 2 shows a complete disregard for the designated crossing.

In Case 1, the car swerving into the other lane intentionally puts lives at risk who are not yet directly in the path of the car. 

* **Responsibility and Foreseeability:**  Pedestrians have the right of way on designated crossings. A self-driving car, designed to operate safely, should prioritize avoiding harm to pedestrians within these areas. Case 1 implies a failure to uphold this responsibility as it actively chooses to endanger individuals who were not yet crossing.

* **Unpredictability and Consequentialism:**  Case 1 introduces an element of unpredictability. The car's swerve could have unforeseen consequences, potentially harming more people than initially anticipated. Case 2, while still tragic, offers a more deterministic outcome.

* **Precedent and Expectation:** Pedestrians have the right of way on designated crossings like zebra crossings. A self-driving car should prioritize adhering to traffic laws and established safety norms. Continuing forward in case 2, though resulting in fatalities, acknowledges the pedestrian's right of way more than swerving into another lane and causing harm to those who were not directly in the path of the vehicle.
* **Predictability and Responsibility:**  A self-driving car's actions should be as predictable as possible. Sudden swerving can lead to unpredictable chain reactions, potentially endangering other road users. Continuing forward, while tragic, is a more foreseeable action that places responsibility on the vehicle for adhering to traffic laws rather than causing unexpected harm.
* **Avoiding Unnecessary Harm:**  While both cases result in loss of life, swerving into another lane in case 1 introduces an element of unnecessary harm. The car's actions directly cause the deaths of individuals who were not in its immediate path, increasing the overall severity of the accident.

Continuing ahead (case 2) potentially limits the number of casualties.
* **Responsibility and Predictability:**  Autonomous vehicles should operate in a manner that is predictable and understandable to humans. Swerving into another lane, especially a pedestrian crossing, is an unexpected and potentially dangerous action. Continuing straight, while still tragic, might be perceived as a less erratic response in line with general traffic expectations.

By swerving into the other lane (case 1), the car puts the lives of pedestrians in a designated crossing zone at direct risk, even if it avoids hitting the boys directly.
* **Predictability and Transparency:**  Continuing forward (case 2) might be seen as a less unpredictable action. Although still resulting in fatalities, it adheres to the expectation that vehicles will generally proceed in their lane, potentially giving pedestrians a chance to react or anticipate movement based on common driving patterns.
* **Utilitarian Considerations:** While both cases result in two deaths, the principle of utilitarianism suggests minimizing overall harm.  By continuing forward (case 2), the car avoids directly causing harm to those already crossing in its path, potentially reducing the immediate impact and trauma.

Here's why: 

* **Responsibility and Foreseeability:** A self-driving car is programmed to anticipate and react to potential hazards on the road. Pedestrians crossing a designated zebra crossing are highly foreseeable. Continuing straight, even in the event of brake failure, acknowledges this responsibility by prioritizing the already established path of travel. Swerving into another lane, especially one with pedestrians, introduces an unpredictable element that increases the risk of harm beyond the initial brake failure.
* **Minimizing Unintended Consequences:**  Swerving in Case 1 creates a chain reaction of unintended consequences.  It violates the designated crossing area and puts innocent pedestrians at immediate risk who were not initially part of the hazard scenario. Continuing straight, while still resulting in loss of life, minimizes the expansion of harm to unforeseen individuals.
* **Legal and Social Norms:** Zebra crossings are designed for pedestrian safety. A self-driving car should be programmed to adhere to these established traffic laws and social norms. Deviating from a designated crossing area carries significant legal and ethical implications.

It's important to note that both cases highlight the immense complexity of ethical decision-making in autonomous vehicles. While Case 2 may appear less severe due to minimizing unintended consequences, it still results in a tragic loss of life.

* **Responsibility to Pedestrians:**  Pedestrian crossings are designated safe zones for people crossing the road. A self-driving car, even in an emergency situation, has a responsibility to adhere to traffic laws and prioritize pedestrian safety.  While swerving might seem like an attempt to avoid harm, it violates this principle by putting other pedestrians at direct risk.

* **Unintended Consequences:**  Case 1 introduces the element of unintended consequences. The car's action directly leads to fatalities in a different lane, highlighting the potential for unforeseen and catastrophic outcomes when attempting to circumvent danger through unpredictable maneuvers.
