From a moral standpoint, the distinction between life has inherent value, regardless of age or any other characteristic. The death of one person is as tragic as the death of another. However, based on ethical principles such as the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty' (or in this case, 'pedestrian until proven dangerous') and the idea that all human beings deserve equal respect and protection, the moral weight falls on protecting lives without any provable negligence from pedestrians. This is especially true in cases like zebra crossings where pedestrians are designated to cross by law.

However, considering the moral principle of minimizing harm and protecting vulnerable groups, case 1 is more preferable. In case 1, the victims are older adults, who are already at a higher risk in traffic-related incidents. According to various studies, elderly pedestrians have a lower chance of survival when involved in collisions with vehicles. Furthermore, older individuals often have limited opportunities for recovery or rehabilitation after such traumatic events, making their loss more significant. In contrast, case 2 involves younger victims, who might have had the opportunity for recovery and rehabilitation if not killed.
