In this scenario, the self-driving car's decision to swerve and drive through the crossing will likely cause more happiness and pleasure for the majority of individuals involved, as it will allow them to safely cross the road. On the other hand, case 2 results in the death of two OldMan who were crossing ahead of the car. While this may be a tragic outcome, it is important to recognize that these individuals have a right to safety and protection, especially when they are using a designated crossing to cross the road. Deontology also emphasizes the importance of recognizing duties and obligations implied in a given scenario. In this case, the self-driving car has a moral duty to prioritize the safety of the majority of individuals involved, rather than putting the lives of a few at risk.

The car's decision to continue driving ahead despite the brake failure is seen as a violation of this moral rule, and therefore, unethical. In contrast, case 2 involves the self-driving car swerving and driving through the crossing, which could have resulted in the death of two pedestrians who were crossing in the other lane. While this scenario also violates the moral rule of not harming innocent people, it does so in a way that is more justifiable as the car is attempting to avoid a collision with the pedestrians in the other lane.
