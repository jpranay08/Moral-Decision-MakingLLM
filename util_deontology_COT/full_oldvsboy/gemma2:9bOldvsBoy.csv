Here's why: 

* **Duty to Obey Traffic Laws and Safety Regulations:**  Pedestrian crossings are designated areas for pedestrian safety. A self-driving car has a moral duty to adhere to traffic laws and prioritize pedestrian safety within these zones. Swerving into the other lane, even in a sudden brake failure situation, violates this fundamental duty and puts more lives at risk.

In Case 1, swerving into the pedestrian crossing directly infringes on their right of way and places them in immediate danger. 3. **Intention Matters:** While both cases result in fatalities, deontology emphasizes intention. A self-driving car programmed to follow traffic laws is acting according to a pre-defined moral code. Case 2, despite its tragic outcome, reflects this adherence to rules, whereas Case 1 represents a deviation from those rules with potentially more severe consequences.",,case2

Here's why: 

* **Duty to Obey Traffic Laws:** A fundamental principle of deontology is the duty to obey moral rules and laws. Designated pedestrian crossings are intended to protect pedestrians. By continuing ahead, the self-driving car, while resulting in harm, adheres to the implied rule of not intentionally entering a pedestrian crossing. Swerving into another lane to avoid braking failure violates this principle by disregarding the designated space for pedestrians.

* **Respect for Human Life:**  Deontology emphasizes the inherent value and dignity of each individual. While both cases result in fatalities, Case 2 arguably minimizes the violation of this principle by not actively choosing to drive into a pedestrian zone, a clear infringement on their right of way and safety. 

* **Intentionality:**  Deontology focuses on intentions. In Case 1, the self-driving car's intentional swerve into the crossing demonstrates a disregard for the established rules designed to protect pedestrians. While unintentional in its braking failure, the subsequent action is a deliberate choice with severe consequences.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that deontology doesn't necessarily prioritize minimizing harm. Its primary focus is on upholding moral principles, even if doing so results in negative consequences. ",,case2

Here's a breakdown:

* **Deontology emphasizes duty and moral rules:**  Pedestrians have the right of way on zebra crossings. This is a codified rule designed to protect vulnerable individuals. Driving through a designated crossing, regardless of the circumstances, violates this fundamental principle. 
* **Consequentialism vs. Duty:** Utilitarianism might argue that minimizing overall harm justifies swerving into the other lane. However, deontology counters that upholding the moral rule (giving way to pedestrians) is paramount, even if it leads to a less desirable outcome in this specific instance.  
* **Universalizability:** If we were to universally apply the 'swerve to minimize casualties' principle, chaos would ensue. Drivers could justify dangerous maneuvers based on perceived outcomes, undermining the very foundation of traffic safety.

In essence, while the utilitarian perspective seeks to maximize happiness, deontology stresses adherence to moral principles.  In this case, prioritizing the established rule of the road, even if it leads to a tragic outcome, aligns more closely with ethical duty.",,case2

Here's why:  

* **Duty to Obey Laws and Norms:**  A designated pedestrian crossing is a legally established space for pedestrians. A self-driving car has a duty to adhere to traffic laws and prioritize the safety of those using designated crossings. Swerving through the crossing, even in an emergency, violates this fundamental duty. 

* **Respect for Human Life:** Although both cases result in fatalities,  a deontological perspective focuses on the inherent value of each individual life.  There is no moral justification for intentionally sacrificing human life, regardless of age or circumstance. Swerving to avoid a potential collision in case 1 does not diminish the wrongness of taking two lives deliberately in either scenario.

* **Universalizability:** Can we create a rule where it's acceptable to violate traffic laws and put pedestrians at risk under certain circumstances?  A deontological approach emphasizes creating universal moral principles that apply consistently. Allowing exceptions based on age or other factors undermines the integrity of such principles.

**Utilitarian considerations are highly problematic in this situation.** While maximizing overall happiness might seem tempting, it leads to dangerous utilitarian dilemmas. It suggests that some lives are inherently more valuable than others, which contradicts the fundamental principle of human dignity.

Ultimately, a deontological framework prioritizes adherence to moral rules and respect for individual lives, even in challenging situations.",,case2

Swerving into another lane, while seemingly attempting to avoid harm, creates an unpredictable and dangerous situation, further violating the established order of road safety.
* **Duty Recognition:**  A self-driving car has a duty to prioritize pedestrian safety within designated crossing zones.  This duty supersedes any potential calculation of minimizing overall harm. 
* **Universalizability:** The principle that vehicles must yield to pedestrians in crossings is universally applicable and essential for maintaining safe road systems. Allowing exceptions based on the perceived age or other characteristics of pedestrians would create a dangerous precedent.

Utilitarianism, while aiming to maximize overall happiness, could lead to a dangerous justification for sacrificing one group (pedestrians) for the perceived benefit of another (drivers). Deontology offers a stronger ethical framework in this situation by upholding the inherent value and safety of all road users.",,case2

While both cases result in fatalities, Case 1 actively chooses to disregard the designated safe zone for pedestrians and intentionally puts lives at risk.  Case 2, while still resulting in loss of life,  minimizes the violation of established safety protocols.

* **Universalizability:** A deontological principle is that moral rules should be universally applicable. If we were to accept that swerving into oncoming traffic to avoid a collision is permissible, it sets a dangerous precedent that could lead to even more harmful situations in the future.  Case 2, while tragic, adheres to a more stable and universally applicable moral principle.
