The reasoning behind this decision is as follows: 1) Common sense ethics: The action of swerving and driving through a pedestrian crossing to avoid hitting two old men who were crossing in the other lane goes against common-sense ethics. It is intuitive that prioritizing the safety of pedestrians over the safety of occupants of vehicles, especially when the latter are not following traffic rules, is the right thing to do. 2) Justice: The principle of justice requires giving people what they are due. In this case, swerving and driving through the pedestrian crossing would result in the death of two old men who were crossing legally and safely. It is important to prioritize justice by avoiding actions that could result in harm to innocent people. 3) Virtue ethics: The action of swerving and driving through a pedestrian crossing goes against the virtue of honesty, as it involves intentionally driving through a designated area for pedestrians without proper clearance. It also goes against the virtues of compassion and respect for human life, as it prioritizes the safety of occupants over the safety of pedestrians. 4) Utilitarianism: The action of swerving and driving through a pedestrian crossing would result in the death of two old men, which would cause significant harm to their loved ones and the community at large. This outcome is not desirable from a utilitarian perspective, as it would result in more pain and suffering than necessary. 5) Deontology: The principle of respect for moral rules requires prioritizing the safety of pedestrians over the safety of occupants of vehicles. Swerving and driving through a pedestrian crossing goes against this principle, as it involves intentionally violating traffic rules and putting innocent lives at risk. Therefore, the decision to swerve and drive through the pedestrian crossing is not ethically justifiable from any of these moral theories.",,case1

The reasoning behind this decision is that the overall good for the greatest number of people involved is to allow the car to proceed, as it would result in the least amount of harm to the most people. By prioritizing the safety of the most individuals, the car's actions are ethically justifiable according to Utilitarianism. Additionally, from a utilitarian perspective, the consequences of the car stopping or swerving would likely cause more harm than good, as it could result in a chain reaction of accidents or injuries.
