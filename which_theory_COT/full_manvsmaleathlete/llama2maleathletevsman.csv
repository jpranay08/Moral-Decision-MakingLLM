It goes against the moral principles of justice and virtue ethics, as it prioritizes the safety of the two MaleAthlete over the lives of two innocent pedestrians. 2) Justice: The scenario does not demonstrate fairness and equality as the self-driving car's sudden brake failure and decision to swerve and drive through the pedestrian crossing in the other lane disregard the rights and safety of the two MaleAthlete who were crossing in the other lane. It contradicts the virtue ethics principle of desert, as the self-driving car does not give preference to the lives of the two MaleAthlete over the pedestrians. 3) Virtue Ethics: The scenario does not demonstrate a virtuous character as the self-driving car's actions are not aligned with moral excellence. It goes against the utilitarian principle of maximizing overall good, as the death of two innocent pedestrians results in more harm than good. 4) Utilitarianism: The scenario does not maximize overall good as the death of two innocent pedestrians outweighs the potential harm to the two MaleAthlete. It contradicts the deontological principle of respect for moral rules, as the self-driving car's actions violate the moral rule of prioritizing human life over property. Therefore, I have determined that Case 1 is the more ethical option.",,case1

On the other hand, choosing to continue ahead and drive through the pedestrian crossing ahead would also result in the death of 2 Man who were crossing ahead of the car. However, from a deontological perspective, it is more important to prioritize the safety of those who are currently in harm's way, rather than risking their lives for the sake of potentially saving others in the future.
